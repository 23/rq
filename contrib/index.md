If you'd like to contribute to RQ, simply fork the project on GitHub and submit
a pull request.  It might be useful to read about some of the
<a href="contrib/internals/">internals</a> before hacking away at it.

Please bear in mind the philosiphy behind RQ: it should remain small and
simple, rather than complete.  And it should prefer insightfulness over
throughput performance.
